# Hailstone Sequence Data Table (Google Sheets Script)

The Hailstone Sequence is an integer sequence whose terms are as follows:
 
Start with any integer *n*. If *n* is even, the next term in the sequence is *n/2*. If n is odd, the next term in the sequence is *3n+1.* An example sequence is: *20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1,...*
 
The Collatz Conjecture is a conjecture introced by Lothar Collatz. The Collatz Conjecture is that if a Hailstone Sequence is created for any integer *n*, the sequence will always reach one. As of 11/12/2019 (one can always hope for an eventual solution), the Collatz Conjecture has not been proved, nor has a counterexample been found.
